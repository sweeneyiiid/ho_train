# Connecting Pi to z21

So the **Roco z21start** that I am using was apparently set up to be used with a preconfigured router sold by Roco.  So the question is, how can I work around that.

There are a couple of issues:
 - can I connect the *pi* directly to the *z21*?
 - can I use the *z21* with a regular router?

I will go into these below.

# Connecting the *Pi* directly to the *z21*

Here are the first things I found, from Roco's webiste:

**connect to PC:**

**connect to other network:**

In addition to that, I have done some previous work on configuring the *Pi*'s networking in my [iwantaboat repo](https://github.com/sweeneyiiid/iwantaboat/tree/master/connection)


# Connecting the *z21* to a regular router

I found some instructions for doing this [on the web](https://www.z21.eu/en/products/z21start-unlock-code).

 - apparently the unlock code is `10818`
 - there is a youtube video included in the page with further instructions
